# Implemented User Input Scanner Program 

>This is a program to demonstrate how to implement `scanf()` function.

>The program simply created based on `getch()` from `conio.h` and ASCII table.

>Everyone can use and share it.

Notes:
* Any characters defined on ASCII Table (not including control characters) can be input.
* Any characters can be deleted one by one using `backspace key`.
* Any strings or spaces can be deleted group by group using `ctrl+backspace key`

### RETURN: char pointer containing of stream until `\r`

> #### Since I used dynamic memory allocation, it will not limit the size of pointer's memory, or it will optimize the pointer's memory to minimum.
